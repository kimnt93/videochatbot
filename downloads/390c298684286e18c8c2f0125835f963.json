So, Ferb, what should we do today? I mean, besides giving Perry a bath. What is that wonderful noise? Awesome. Ferb, I know what we're going to do today. I've got to take a new picture of myself for my blog. I didn't realize mine is already a week old. That's better. What are you doing to Mom's car? He tricked it out. You don't even know how to drive. Well, duh. That's why I threw both this remote. Oh, you are so busted. Mom! Mom! Mom! Um, where's Mom? She's playing bridge at Mrs. Garcia Shapiro's. They won't get away with it this time.

Oy vey, look how tall you are now. You must have grown a couple of inches since the last time I saw you. That was last week, Mrs. Garcinia Shapiro. Well, your mom's inside, dear. Wear your braces. I thought you were wearing braces. Yeah. Mom! Mom! Mom! What is it, Candace? You have got to see what Phineas and Ferb are doing. Hey, Bert, what's the red button for? Mom! What is it? What do you want me to see? Hi, Mom. Hi, boys. Well, if that's all, I'll just be getting back to the game. Good thing we beefed up the suspension. Whoa! What else can it do? Hi, Phineas. Oh, hi, Isabella. Whatcha doing? We're entering the Swamp Oil 500 today. Aren't you gonna need a pit crew? Do you know a pit crew? Well, I know a few people who work well together. Great. You're hired. See you at the track. Hey, Ferb, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons completely unknown, he's purchased a giant airship, or blimp, as the kids say. Your mission is to find out why, and, if necessary, put a stop to it. Hi, Phineas. I got your pit crew. Cool. See you in the pits. Okay, girls, we're dealing with a 426 cubic inch fully blown V8 with hypo lifters, radical cam, and a limited clip differential. Would that be electronically fuel injected? Remy S! Remy S! Remy S! Hey, I can't hear the cars. Hey, Candace, I didn't know you were a racing fan. Jeremy. Who, me? Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm a big fan of those, uh, that robot is cute. Oh, that's Billy Ray Diggler's car. He's great. Yeah, he's the best. That Billy Roy. Billy Ray. Billy Ray. I love it when he turns left and then he turns left again and then... And in the third lane, the newcomer's team, Finneas. Now, is it just me or does he look a little bit young to be behind the wheel of a 700 horsepower racing machine? Yes, yes he does. And look, he's already got his own screaming fans. Finneas! Hey, Candace is rooting for us. Candace, you're on the big screen. And your little brother's going to be on TV. On TV? TV, that's it! They are so busted. Can you wait right here for a second? Thanks. What is it, Candace? I'm right in the middle of a three-note trump. Turn on the TV! All right, all right, Candace. This better be good. Well, well, they see it. Just a second, honey. Turn on the kibble box first. All right. Wait. Okay, that's not it. Um, is it this one? No, this is another phone. Oh, it's Aaron on the stereo. Mom, hurry up! Okay, just a second.

You're just in time to witness my latest invention! my deflating which I will demonstrate by deflating all the tires at the Jefferson County Motor Speedway after which I will deflate everything in the tri-state area that way if anyone wants anything deflated they will have to talk to me idiot you are Candace you've got a little smile Oh, Sylvanaire picture, only a dollar. Wait a second! Hey! Now I gotcha! Hey, hey, Misty, two pictures, two bucks. Oh, yeah, I've only got a dollar, but I just want the one. You can just tear the other one up. Okay. I've got him now! And hold up fast on the inside lane, number 42, Team Phineas! Hey, Ferb, do you think we can get any more power? I mean, I know it's just a battery, but I was thinking... Let's open it up and see what this puppy gets. Uh, Ferb, you're actually slowing down now. Ferb... Oh? Oh, yeah! Now that's what I'm talking about! Hey, Ferb, we should bring Phineas in for a pit stop. All right, I'm sorry, girls. Let's move, move, move! That helmet looks so manly.

I got it! Oh, yeah! The team in this car is avoiding every obstacle. It's likely to see the whole dark track at once. Oh, yeah! We're okay! Well, Mom, what do you think of this? You've looked better. Huh? What do you mean? Already they fear me. Listen to their screams, huh? Imagine the mayhem once my deflationator ray is fully charged. Run, run like the wind, my little indentured rodent. And I will give you some cheese. I know I had someone around there somewhere. There used to be some rosebuds in the back here. I don't... Hmm? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

It's about to hit the broadcasting tower. Oh, value. Uh-huh. Meep Steal me back in, Viv Hmm, looks like we're walking Where did you go back home, Candace? Am I busy with my bridge game, Candace? She has no idea. Gotcha! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Oh, Candace, hello. I can't believe you've grown so much. It's unbelievable. Mom! Mom, you've got to see this. It's about your car. All right. Come on, come on, come on. Candace you wearing out the heels of my shoes See Mom Look look I told you But who did this Phineas and Ferb You mean Yeah yeah yeah They washed my car? Yes! No! What? It's beautiful! I gotta admit, I thought you were exaggerating a bit. But this is really worth getting excited about. Hi, Mom. We're home. Hey, boys! I saw what you did today. Yeah? How'd you like it? I loved it. And who wants some snacks? Thanks, Mom. Honey, close your mouth. This is Stanky Dog coming to you on the hottest day of the summer. So unless you live at the beach, I say take it easy and do nothing today. Yep, just find yourself a shady tree and maybe an aquatic mammal of some sort and blow the whole day off. Come on, Ferb. If we let a little heat stop us from having the best day ever, then the morning DJs win. Whew, boy, it's hot today. So what are you up to? We're making our own beach right here in the backyard. Oh, how cute. Well, I'm off for my spa day. You boys behave yourselves and don't bother your father. He's finally cleaning out the basement. Bye, Mom. Yes. You heard her. We can't bug Dad, which makes me in charge. By default. Carry on. We're going to need more sand. Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. Lawn gnomes across the tri-state area are disappearing, leaving thousands of gardens unprotected from the eagles of black magic. We suspect doofenshmirtz. Get right on it. Aren't you a little young to be a landscape contractor? Yes. Yes, I am. Hi, Phineas. Oh, hey, Isabella. Whatcha doin'? Building a beach. Check it out. Can me and the other fireside girls be lifeguards? We need to earn our aquatic safety badges. Sure. I mean, I've been a friend of Susie's longer than Katie, so I should have invited her to that party first. Who cares? They're lab partners. We're locker neighbors, and locker neighbors come to lab partners any day. Sorry, Susie. Gotta go. Welcome to our beach. You call that a beach? This is way below your usual standard. This isn't even worth a call to mom. You know, if you guys ever want to be popular, you're going to have to stop playing in the sandbox. Hey! So, Candace, what do you think? That's it. I'm calling Mom. Hey, Candace. Jenny? Cece? You never told us you had a beach in your backyard. You're going to be the most popular girl in the neighborhood. I will? I just saw Jeremy and his buddies with their surfboards. Jeremy's here? Gotta go. Oh, yes. Yes. Just look at my bounty of gnome riches. Oh, this is a strange one. Wait, who are you? A platypus? Perry the platypus? You are mine now! Oh, no, wait, wait, wait. It was the garage door opening. You are mine now! And that was the TV remote. I've got to start labeling these things. Aha! You are mine now! Finally, I will rid myself of you But first, turn your attention to the giant screen Maybe I need to turn the cable on first? Let's get this beef party started Well, we wake up early and wash our surfboards down Don't you know what it's like? We throw our boards your turn and head for surfing. Hey, look! I can see our house from up here! How low can you go? How low can you go? Look! So that's how low you can go. Even asking that question for generations. What? What's that great looking at? For winning the limbo contest, you are now officially crowned Queen Wahine of the Beach. All hail Queen Wahine! I can't believe it! Listen up, people in the beach. I'm Phineas and Ferb and I'll back your nature. Every morning, Phineas is gonna say, brother, what you gonna do today? Now you see we're having fun playing under the sun And getting nine, getting nine Cause the rest keeps running A backyard beach, a backyard beach Nothing's out to reach, we got the backyard beach You can change in the broken height Drink out of a coconut Three games for a token, but the rest is free You got Dee and Sarah sailing Surfing in the tail And you got taxi sailing The rest you can't see That's a backyard beach, a backyard beach Nothing's out to reach, we got the backyard beach That's a backyard beach, a backyard beach Don't fall into the breach Got the backyard beach. I've never been happier in my entire life. Something is very wrong. Not a single call from Candace. Not even a text message. Olga, hose me down. I'm going home. Okay, I think I finally got the right one. Now, Perry the Platypus, you will finally understand my pain. Back in Gimmelstumpf in the days of my youth the Doofenshmirtzes were a proud family But those were lean times when my father and our beloved Lorno was repossessed Who would protect our Zatzentruth garden from witch's spells and wood trolls? From a tender age, my father decided that it would be me. While the other children played Kippestumpf on their dunkelberries, I would stand for hours. All through the cold night As the Spitzenhound howled My only companion was the moon And my neighbor, Kenny And since my lawn gnome was taken away from me I will destroy every lawn gnome in the entire tri-state area Behold the destruction acorn And now, Perry the Platypus To activate my creation Surf contest Out of my way, Jenna Bell Hello, Buford Perhaps you missed the sun No bullying, no yodeling I don't like this any more than you do First up in the surf contest, Bobby Nelson Oh, and Nelson eats it on a five-footer And there's Django Brown shooting the curl And here comes Buford Von Starr Oh, he pummels Brown with a Philadelphia traffic star And now he's got him in a half, Nelson Now a full Nelson Oh, and now he's actually beating him with Bobby Nelson. Here's the scores from our judges, and Buford doesn't like it one bit. Next up is Phineas Flynn. It is great to see a young surfer show such confidence. Uh-oh, what's this? Oh, those kids today and their holographic projections. He's in the pipeline. Now he's hanging 10. He's hanging 20. He's hanging 32. Now he's just hanging. The crowd loves it. I don't think there's a name for that. The crowd is doing the wave, and Phineas is surfing it. Let's go to the judges. 10 to the 5th power, infinity, and oh, it seems Sidious Flynn's radical serving has made judge number 3 rethink Einstein's theory of relativity. Cowabunga, laws of nature! So, are you having fun? Girl, the moment has arrived. Just one second. Hello? Um, Candace, is everything okay? Oh, everything is just wonderful. And Phineas and Ferb, what are they doing? Oh, such wonderful things. Candace, honey, I'm coming home. Wait, what? I'm right around the corner. I'll be there in two minutes. Wait, no, Mom, you can't. Oh, wait, wait. Stay right there. Not to stop her. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Mom, Mom, please, Mom, go away. Don't come in. Is that Volcano? No! Run for your lives. It's No-Mageddon. Who's protecting our gardens? Candace, tell me the truth. What is going on here? Phineas and Ferb built a beach in the backyard just like they said they were going to, but instead of just a cute little beach in their sandbox, it turned out to be this absolutely huge beach with a coastline and palm trees and a pier and hula dancers and water skiers and cheeky heads and dolphins and dancing and surfing and everybody from the neighborhood showed up. And then I was just about to share a smoothie with Jeremy when a coconut dropped on my head and... Just for a moment, it seemed that the wily Buford would steal away the coveted surfing trophy from under the noses of our heroes? But I can only continue my benign reign and spread love, happiness, and ultimate popularity throughout my kingdom. If you would just let me have my moment. Oh, there you are, Perry. Well, everybody, looks like that's all for today If you don't believe me, go see for yourself That was great Hey, boys Hey, Mom So how was your day at the beach? Wait, wait, my kingdom, my Jeremy, it was all so beautiful What have you done to my paradise? Candace, honey, I think it's time to get you out of the sun for a little while I think she had fun It's summer only Lasted one day Thank you all here with a special shout out To my two new pals Phineas and Ferb For hosting a beach party that was hot hot hot And speaking of hot Slather on the sunscreen listeners Cause tomorrow's weather calls for another scorcher With a slight chance of scattered lawnmowers He's a semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammal of action He's a furry little fat foot who'll never flinch from a prey He's got more than just mad skill He's got a beaver tail and a bill And the women swoon whatever they hear him say He's Perry Perry the Platypus Thank you.",

0:16:03.240000\nA backyard beach, a backyard beach\n\n0:16:03.240000 --> 0:16:05.760000\nNothing's out to reach, we got the backyard beach\n\n0:16:05.760000 --> 0:16:07.300050\nYou can change in the broken height\n\n0:16:07.300050 --> 0:16:08.380000\nDrink out of a coconut\n\n0:16:08.380000 --> 0:16:10.800050\nThree games for a token, but the rest is free\n\n0:16:10.800050 --> 0:16:12.240000\nYou got Dee and Sarah sailing\n\n0:16:12.240000 --> 0:16:13.400000\nSurfing in the tail\n\n0:16:13.400000 --> 0:16:14.720030\nAnd you got taxi sailing\n\n0:16:14.720030 --> 0:16:15.860000\nThe rest you can't see\n\n0:16:15.860000 --> 0:16:18.420040\nThat's a backyard beach, a backyard beach\n\n0:16:18.420040 --> 0:16:20.920040\nNothing's out to reach, we got the backyard beach\n\n0:16:20.920040 --> 0:16:23.420040\nThat's a backyard beach, a backyard beach\n\n0:16:23.420040 --> 0:16:24.720030\nDon't fall into the breach\n\n0:16:24.720030 --> 0:16:26.020000\nGot the backyard beach.\n\n0:16:27.060060 --> 0:16:30.620000\nI've never been happier in my entire life.\n\n0:16:31.340000 --> 0:16:32.680050\nSomething is very wrong.\n\n0:16:33.220030 --> 0:16:35.160030\nNot a single call from Candace.\n\n0:16:35.480040 --> 0:16:36.700000\nNot even a text message.\n\n0:16:37.040040 --> 0:16:38.240000\nOlga, hose me down.\n\n0:16:38.360000 --> 0:16:39\nI'm going home.\n\n0:16:39.140000 --> 0:16:40.860000\nOkay, I think I finally got the right one.\n\n0:16:41.440060 --> 0:16:46.480040\nNow, Perry the Platypus, you will finally understand my pain.\n\n0:16:48.280000 --> 0:16:58.490000\nBack in Gimmelstumpf in the days of my youth the Doofenshmirtzes were a proud family But those were lean times when my father and our beloved Lorno was repossessed\n\n0:16:58.890000 --> 0:17:02.490000\nWho would protect our Zatzentruth garden from witch's spells and wood trolls?\n\n0:17:02.950000 --> 0:17:06.770000\nFrom a tender age, my father decided that it would be me.\n\n0:17:06.770000 --> 0:17:14.350000\nWhile the other children played Kippestumpf on their dunkelberries, I would stand for hours.\n\n0:17:14.350000 --> 0:17:17.850000\nAll through the cold night\n\n0:17:17.850000 --> 0:17:19.570100\nAs the Spitzenhound howled\n\n0:17:19.570100 --> 0:17:22.650000\nMy only companion was the moon\n\n0:17:22.650000 --> 0:17:24.130000\nAnd my neighbor, Kenny\n\n0:17:24.130000 --> 0:17:28.550000\nAnd since my lawn gnome was taken away from me\n\n0:17:28.550000 --> 0:17:34.850000\nI will destroy every lawn gnome in the entire tri-state area\n\n0:17:34.850000 --> 0:17:37.850000\nBehold the destruction acorn\n\n0:17:37.850000 --> 0:17:40.330000\nAnd now, Perry the Platypus\n\n0:17:40.330000 --> 0:17:42.670000\nTo activate my creation\n\n0:17:42.670000 --> 0:17:48.990000\nSurf contest\n\n0:17:48.990000 --> 0:17:51.370000\nOut of my way, Jenna Bell\n\n0:17:51.370000 --> 0:17:52.270000\nHello, Buford\n\n0:17:52.270000 --> 0:17:53.510000\nPerhaps you missed the sun\n\n0:17:53.510000 --> 0:17:55.590000\nNo bullying, no yodeling\n\n0:17:55.590000 --> 0:17:57.630000\nI don't like this any more than you do\n\n0:17:57.630000 --> 0:18:00.050000\nFirst up in the surf contest, Bobby Nelson\n\n0:18:00.050000 --> 0:18:02.210000\nOh, and Nelson eats it on a five-footer\n\n0:18:02.210000 --> 0:18:04.050000\nAnd there's Django Brown shooting the curl\n\n0:18:04.050000 --> 0:18:05.890000\nAnd here comes Buford Von Starr\n\n0:18:05.890000 --> 0:18:09.370000\nOh, he pummels Brown with a Philadelphia traffic star\n\n0:18:09.370000 --> 0:18:10.590000\nAnd now he's got him in a half, Nelson\n\n0:18:10.590000 --> 0:18:11.570100\nNow a full Nelson\n\n0:18:11.910000 --> 0:18:14.470000\nOh, and now he's actually beating him with Bobby Nelson.\n\n0:18:14.810000 --> 0:18:17.870000\nHere's the scores from our judges, and Buford doesn't like it one bit.\n\n0:18:18.370000 --> 0:18:19.890000\nNext up is Phineas Flynn.\n\n0:18:20.070100 --> 0:18:22.430000\nIt is great to see a young surfer show such confidence.\n\n0:18:22.790000 --> 0:18:23.770000\nUh-oh, what's this?\n\n0:18:24.330000 --> 0:18:27.050000\nOh, those kids today and their holographic projections.\n\n0:18:27.630000 --> 0:18:28.310000\nHe's in the pipeline.\n\n0:18:28.590000 --> 0:18:29.350000\nNow he's hanging 10.\n\n0:18:29.530000 --> 0:18:30.310000\nHe's hanging 20.\n\n0:18:30.510000 --> 0:18:31.690100\nHe's hanging 32.\n\n0:18:32.030000 --> 0:18:33.110000\nNow he's just hanging.\n\n0:18:33.430000 --> 0:18:34.410000\nThe crowd loves it.\n\n0:18:34.670000 --> 0:18:36.050000\nI don't think there's a name for that.\n\n0:18:36.050000 --> 0:18:39.530000\nThe crowd is doing the wave, and Phineas is surfing it.\n\n0:18:39.830000 --> 0:18:41.010000\nLet's go to the judges.\n\n0:18:41.570100 --> 0:18:50.530000\n10 to the 5th power, infinity, and oh, it seems Sidious Flynn's radical serving has made judge number 3 rethink Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\n0:18:51.190100 --> 0:18:52.610000\nCowabunga, laws of nature!\n\n0:18:53.910000 --> 0:18:55.990000\nSo, are you having fun?\n\n0:18:59.950000 --> 0:19:04.230000\nGirl, the moment has arrived.\n\n0:19:06.790000 --> 0:19:08.330100\nJust one second.\n\n0:19:09.030000 --> 0:19:09.710000\nHello?\n\n0:19:10.550000
