  "full_text": "China is having a field day making fun of the\u00a0\nfirst US Presidential Debate of the 2024 election\u00a0\u00a0 cycle! Sadly, they\u2019re kind of right to. But\u00a0\nBeijing\u2019s watching for more reasons than humor.\u00a0 Welcome to China Uncensored, I\u2019m Chris Chappell.\u00a0 Today, July 1 is the 27 year anniversary\u00a0\nof the British handover of Hong Kong to\u00a0\u00a0 China. So real quick, before I begin this episode, five years ago, Matt, Shelley, and I were\u00a0\nin Hong Kong watching two million people\u00a0\u00a0 march through the streets to protest the\u00a0\nHK government and, ultimately, the CCP.\u00a0 So to commemorate it, China Uncensored is\u00a0\npartnering with the Hong Kong Democracy Council\u00a0\u00a0 to create the first ever digital Hong Kong Lennon\u00a0\nWall. A place for people around the world to\u00a0\u00a0 show their support for Hongkongers by writing\u00a0\ndigital post-it notes of support for Hong Kong. Again, that website is Hklennonwall.com\u00a0\n. I\u2019ll leave a link below. We built this\u00a0\u00a0 site with a team of security experts. It\u2019s\u00a0\ncompletely anonymous. It does not track cookies\u00a0\u00a0 or any other personal information.\u00a0\nIt does not store IP addresses. If you\u2019ve already signed, thank you,\u00a0\u00a0 and please ask your friends and family to\u00a0\nsign as well. Let\u2019s see how many we can get! And now, on to the rest of the show. Late last week, the US held the first\u00a0\u00a0 of the 2024 presidential debates,\u00a0\nfeaturing Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And there were many, many reasons\u00a0\nto be concerned after watching it.\u00a0 One big reason to be concerned is that China\u00a0\nseems to be having a field day mocking the debate. Chinese media outlets and prominent social\u00a0\nmedia users weighed in, commenting on the\u00a0\u00a0 age of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump,\u00a0\nas well as their perceived shortcomings.\u00a0 Hu Xijin, the former editor in chief\u00a0\nof my favorite chinese state run media,\u00a0\u00a0 the Global Times , wrote on X,\u00a0 \u201cpersonal attacks, hazy memory,\u00a0\nmocking each other\u2026this debate was\u00a0\u00a0 very entertaining. Objectively speaking, the\u00a0\nlow-quality performance of these two old men\u00a0\u00a0 was a negative advertisement\u00a0\nfor Western democracy.\u201d Remember folks, China has the best democracy! Just ask the Uyghurs. Hu wasn\u2019t the only one\u00a0\ncommenting on the debate, though. Financial news site Cailianshe wrote\u00a0\nof the matchup, \u201cthis chaotic rhythm\u00a0\u00a0 almost dominated the entire debate, and many\u00a0\npeople lamented: one has Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u00a0\u00a0 and the other is mentally ill,\u00a0\nthey are really evenly matched.\u201d State-owned Beijing News also chimed in! It\u00a0\nsaid that \u201cBiden was habitually confused,\u00a0\u00a0 and Trump continued to spread rumors.\u201d On social media, the debate was\u00a0\nlikened to a \u201ckindergarten quarrel!\u201d\u00a0 Although, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u00a0\na fair assessment. Considering\u00a0\u00a0 the age of the candidates, it\u2019s more\u00a0\nlike a 3PM dinner quarrel at Denny\u2019s. Remember, China has no presidential debates or\u00a0\u00a0 elections, and Xi Jinping is no\u00a0\nspring chicken at 71 years old. But one of the dangers of the debate gone\u00a0\nwrong is exactly that\u2013the Chinese Communist\u00a0\u00a0 Party does not have scenes of elderly, incoherent\u00a0\ncandidates rambling on or shouting at each other. Of course sometimes elderly former\u00a0\nleaders get, uhh\u2026escorted away. For years, the CCP has been claiming\u00a0\nthat its one-party system is, in fact,\u00a0\u00a0 a democracy, even one that\u00a0\nworks better than the US. So the CCP is using the debate as an\u00a0\nexample of why US-style democracy is bad and might actually be less preferable\u00a0\nthan the so-called \u201cChinese Model\u201d that\u00a0\u00a0 Beijing has tried to export\u00a0\nto various other countries. And some popular influencers on Weibo , China\u2019s\u00a0\nversion of X, are already making that point. Chu Mingyu, who has 1.9 million\u00a0\nWeibo followers, wrote, \u201cthis just\u00a0\u00a0 points out the fundamental problem of American\u00a0\ndemocracy. Americans don\u2019t elect a president,\u00a0\u00a0 but someone who is more suitable to play\u00a0\nthe president on TV.\u201d And she goes on in\u00a0\u00a0 her post to say that Trump is a liar, but that\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s rambling incoherence was even worse. In an even more savage Weibo post about the\u00a0\ndebate, popular blogger Housha Moonlight,\u00a0\u00a0 with almost 4 million followers, wrote that\u00a0\nit didn\u2019t matter what the debate was about,\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cthe key is that the witty & flexible\u00a0\nTrump successfully highlighted the\u00a0\u00a0 old and dying appearance of the sleeping king.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous, Biden isn\u2019t the\u00a0\nsleeping king. The My Pillow guy is.\u00a0\u00a0 And he endorsed Trump\u00a0 As of recording, Xi Jinping hasn\u2019t\u00a0\npublicly commented on the debate. But others on social media sites in China have\u00a0\u00a0 continued mocking Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0\nseeming lack of awareness, as well as some dubious claims from Trump. In fact, the debate seems to have garnered\u00a0\nso much attention in China that a company\u00a0\u00a0 whose Mandarin name sounds like \u201cTrump\u00a0\nWins Big\u201d saw a surge of 10% in shares!\u2028\u00a0 But it\u2019s only fair that China talks so much\u00a0\nabout the debate because the candidates sure\u00a0\u00a0 talked about China a lot during the debate.\u00a0\nDonald Trump mentioned China a dozen times.\u00a0\u00a0 Only Russia was mentioned more when\u00a0\nit came to foreign policy questions! Which shouldn\u2019t be surprising, since we all know\u00a0\u00a0 how much Trump loves talking about China.\u00a0\nClips of Trump saying China over and over I\u2019ve really missed that. During the debate, Trump hailed his policies\u00a0\non China during his tenure in the White House,\u00a0\u00a0 while accusing Biden of being soft on China. Trump: We're closer to World War III than\u00a0\nanybody can imagine. We are very very close\u00a0\u00a0 to World War III, and he's driving us there,\u00a0\nand Kim Jong-un and President Xi of China,\u00a0\u00a0 Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of these, Putin,\u00a0\nthey don't respect him. They don't fear him.\u00a0 Trump: We have the largest deficit with\u00a0\nChina. He gets paid by China. He's a\u00a0\u00a0 Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China.\u00a0\nWe have, so I think he's afraid to deal with them\u00a0\u00a0 or something. But you notice he never took out my\u00a0\ntariffs because we bring in so much money with the\u00a0\u00a0 tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took\u00a0\nthem away. Can't, because it's too much money. Biden got in on the China action, as\u00a0\nwell, though without the Trumpian flair. Biden: Number two: you have not in fact\u00a0\nmade any contact, any any any progress with\u00a0\u00a0 China. We are the lowest trade\u00a0\ndeficit with China since 2010. Trump has promised not just to resume his\u00a0\nprevious China policies, but to ramp them up. According to Bloomsberg, \u201cTrump\u00a0\nhas already floated ideas including\u00a0\u00a0 a 10% across-the-board tariff, and\u00a0\nsteeper levies on Chinese-made goods.\u201d Back in February it was talk of more\u00a0\nthan 60% tariffs on Chinese imports. And that\u2019s causing some level of alarm in Beijing! Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for China\u2019s\u00a0\nEmbassy in the US , said \u201con China-U.S. trade,\u00a0\u00a0 I want to stress that China-U.S. economic\u00a0\nand trade cooperation is mutually beneficial\u00a0\u00a0 in nature.\u201d He also said that \u201cno one\u00a0\nwill win a trade war or a tariff war.\u201d He also said that \u201cno one will\u00a0\nwin a trade war or a tariff war.\u201d Which is curious, since China is\u00a0\ncurrently pursuing tit-for-tat\u00a0\u00a0 anti-dumping measures for\u00a0\nimports of European pork. Liu also stated that China won\u2019t interfere in the\u00a0\nUS elections, and that it hopes for development\u00a0\u00a0 in US-China relations no matter who wins the\u00a0\nelection. But he did say that the CCP opposes\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cthe US frequently making an\u00a0\nissue of China in the election.\u201d China won\u2019t interfere in the elections? I\u00a0\nwouldn\u2019t put too much stock in that statement! China is already seeking to interfere in the\u00a0\nUS election, as it has with other countries. The question is what the Chinese Communist Party,\u00a0\u00a0 with now the largest navy in the world, wil\u00a0\ndo if it views the US as being unstable. It\u2019s unclear exactly what either Trump or Biden\u00a0\nwould do regarding China if elected, but you\u00a0\u00a0 can be sure of one thing: China Uncensored will\u00a0\nalways call the CCP out, but we need your help. For as little as a dollar a month,\u00a0\u00a0 you can support us on Patreon so\u00a0\nthat we can keep uncensoring China, and as a thank you to our Patreon supporters,\u00a0\u00a0 I answer one of your questions\u00a0\nat the end of these episodes. Today\u2019s question comes from Fast Zombies\u00a0\n\u201cI think CCP's death row is going to be\u00a0\u00a0 pretty crowded if supporting\u00a0\nthe ROC is a capital offense.\u201d So Fast Zombies is responding\u00a0\nto China\u2019s recent announcement\u00a0 That it will give the death penalty\u00a0\nto Taiwan independence diehards.\u2028\u00a0 Since it technically applies to\u00a0\nanyone, anywhere in the world,\u00a0\u00a0 yeah, death row would be pretty crowded. Of course right now the CCP\u00a0\ncan\u2019t enforce it like that,\u00a0\u00a0 but I think they would be very happy\u00a0\nto have more prisoners on death row. You see, China has no functional\u00a0\norgan donation system. So they were harvesting organs\u00a0\nfrom executed prisoners. But they didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cSome of the more than 1.5 million\u00a0\ndetainees in Chinese prison camps\u00a0\u00a0 are being killed for their organs to\u00a0\nserve a booming transplant trade that\u00a0\u00a0 is worth some $1 billion a year,\u00a0\nconcluded the China Tribunal,\u00a0\u00a0 an independent body tasked with investigating\u00a0\norgan harvesting from prisoners of conscience\u201d For clarity, that\u2019s not talking\u00a0\nabout people who committed a crime.\u00a0 The Communist Party launched\u00a0\na massive persecution of Falun\u00a0\u00a0 Gong practitioners in 1999, using them\u00a0\nas a massive \u201cvolunteer\u201d organ bank.\u00a0 When that source got depleted They turned to Uyghurs. And according to China Journalist Ethan Gutmann,\u00a0\u00a0 whose book the Slaughter exposed\u00a0\nChina\u2019s organ transplant system\u2026 \u00a0If China successfully conquers it,\u00a0\nTaiwan will be the next organ bank. Remember,\u00a0 \u201ca booming transplant trade that\u00a0\nis worth some $1 billion a year\u201d And no organ donation system. Think about that. So thank you for your question and\u00a0\nyour support Fast Zombie. That\u2019s what\u00a0\u00a0 makes it possible for me to spread awareness\u00a0\nabout things like China\u2019s organ harvesting.

So real quick, before I begin this episode,\n\n0:00:23.240000 --> 0:00:28\nfive years ago, Matt, Shelley, and I were\u00a0\nin Hong Kong watching two million people\n\n0:00:28 --> 0:00:33.240000\nmarch through the streets to protest the\u00a0\nHK government and, ultimately, the CCP.\n\n0:00:33.240000 --> 0:00:37.960000\nSo to commemorate it, China Uncensored is\u00a0\npartnering with the Hong Kong Democracy Council\n\n0:00:37.960000 --> 0:00:43.360000\nto create the first ever digital Hong Kong Lennon\u00a0\nWall.

Let\u2019s see how many we can get!\n\n0:01:10.680000 --> 0:01:13.480000\nAnd now, on to the rest of the show.\n\n0:01:13.480000 --> 0:01:18.600000\nLate last week, the US held the first\n\n0:01:18.600000 --> 0:01:21.920000\nof the 2024 presidential debates,\u00a0\nfeaturing Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\n0:01:21.920000 --> 0:01:28.560000\nAnd there were many, many reasons\u00a0\nto be concerned after watching it.\n\n0:01:28.560000 --> 0:01:34.440000\nOne big reason to be concerned is that China\u00a0\nseems to be having a field day mocking the debate.\n\n0:01:34.440000 --> 0:01:39\nChinese media outlets and prominent social\u00a0\nmedia users weighed in, commenting on the\n\n0:01:39 --> 0:01:44.080000\nage of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump,\u00a0\nas well as their perceived shortcomings.\n\n0:01:44.080000 --> 0:01:47.640000\nHu Xijin, the former editor in chief\u00a0\nof my favorite chinese state run media,\n\n0:01:47.640000 --> 0:01:49.960000\nthe Global Times , wrote on X,\n\n0:01:49.960000 --> 0:01:54.320000\n\u201cpersonal attacks, hazy memory,\u00a0\nmocking each other\u2026this debate was\n\n0:01:54.320000 --> 0:01:59.840000\nvery entertaining. Objectively speaking, the\u00a0\nlow-quality performance of these two old men\n\n0:02:00.360000 --> 0:02:04.400000\nwas a negative advertisement\u00a0\nfor Western democracy.\u201d\n\n0:02:04.400000 --> 0:02:07.520000\nRemember folks, China has the best democracy!\n\n0:02:07.520000 --> 0:02:09.440000\nJust ask the Uyghurs.\n\n0:02:09.440000 --> 0:02:12.440000\nHu wasn\u2019t the only one\u00a0\ncommenting on the debate, though.\n\n0:02:12.440000 --> 0:02:17.680000\nFinancial news site Cailianshe wrote\u00a0\nof the matchup, \u201cthis chaotic rhythm\n\n0:02:17.680000 --> 0:02:23.680000\nalmost dominated the entire debate, and many\u00a0\npeople lamented: one has Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\n\n0:02:23.680000 --> 0:02:27.640000\nand the other is mentally ill,\u00a0\nthey are really evenly matched.\u201d\n\n0:02:27.640000 --> 0:02:32.800000\nState-owned Beijing News also chimed in! It\u00a0\nsaid that \u201cBiden was habitually confused,\n\n0:02:32.800000 --> 0:02:35.520000\nand Trump continued to spread rumors.\u201d\n\n0:02:35.520000 --> 0:02:39.400000\nOn social media, the debate was\u00a0\nlikened to a \u201ckindergarten quarrel!\u201d\n\n0:02:39.400000 --> 0:02:42\nAlthough, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u00a0\na fair assessment. Considering\n\n0:02:42 --> 0:02:46.320000\nthe age of the candidates, it\u2019s more\u00a0\nlike a 3PM dinner quarrel at Denny\u2019s.\n\n0:02:46.320000 --> 0:02:49.280000\nRemember, China has no presidential debates or\n\n0:02:49.280000 --> 0:02:53.440000\nelections, and Xi Jinping is no\u00a0\nspring chicken at 71 years old.\n\n0:02:53.440000 --> 0:02:58.040000\nBut one of the dangers of the debate gone\u00a0\nwrong is exactly that\u2013the Chinese Communist\n\n0:02:58.040000 --> 0:03:05.040000\nParty does not have scenes of elderly, incoherent\u00a0\ncandidates rambling on or shouting at each other.\n\n0:03:05.040000 --> 0:03:10.760000\nOf course sometimes elderly former\u00a0\nleaders get, uhh\u2026escorted away.\n\n0:03:10.760000 --> 0:03:16.240000\nFor years, the CCP has been claiming\u00a0\nthat its one-party system is, in fact,\n\n0:03:16.240000 --> 0:03:20.240000\na democracy, even one that\u00a0\nworks better than the US.\n\n0:03:20.240000 --> 0:03:26.600000\nSo the CCP is using the debate as an\u00a0\nexample of why US-style democracy is bad\n\n0:03:26.600000 --> 0:03:31.360000\nand might actually be less preferable\u00a0\nthan the so-called \u201cChinese Model\u201d that\n\n0:03:31.360000 --> 0:03:34.880000\nBeijing has tried to export\u00a0\nto various other countries.\n\n0:03:34.880000 --> 0:03:40.240000\nAnd some popular influencers on Weibo , China\u2019s\u00a0\nversion of X, are already making that point.\n\n0:03:40.240000 --> 0:03:44.720000\nChu Mingyu, who has 1.9 million\u00a0\nWeibo followers, wrote, \u201cthis just\n\n0:03:44.720000 --> 0:03:50.360000\npoints out the fundamental problem of American\u00a0\ndemocracy. Americans don\u2019t elect a president,\n\n0:03:50.360000 --> 0:03:54.480000\nbut someone who is more suitable to play\u00a0\nthe president on TV.\u201d And she goes on in\n\n0:03:54.480000 --> 0:04:00.080000\nher post to say that Trump is a liar, but that\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s rambling incoherence was even worse.\n\n0:04:00.080000 --> 0:04:04.960000\nIn an even more savage Weibo post about the\u00a0\ndebate, popular blogger Housha Moonlight,\n\n0:04:04.960000 --> 0:04:09.080000\nwith almost 4 million followers, wrote that\u00a0\nit didn\u2019t matter what the debate was about,\n\n0:04:09.080000 --> 0:04:13.320000\n\u201cthe key is that the witty & flexible\u00a0\nTrump successfully highlighted the\n\n0:04:13.320000 --> 0:04:17.880000\nold and dying appearance of the sleeping king.\u201d\n\n0:04:17.880000 --> 0:04:22.160000\nThat\u2019s ridiculous, Biden isn\u2019t the\u00a0\nsleeping king. The My Pillow guy is.\n\n0:04:22.160000 --> 0:04:24.440000\nAnd he endorsed Trump\n\n0:04:24.440000 --> 0:04:28\nAs of recording, Xi Jinping hasn\u2019t\u00a0\npublicly commented on the debate.\n\n0:04:28 --> 0:04:30.400000\nBut others on social media sites in China have\n\n0:04:30.400000 --> 0:04:34.200000\ncontinued mocking Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0\nseeming lack of awareness,\n\n0:04:34.200000 --> 0:04:36.920000\nas well as some dubious claims from Trump.\n\n0:04:36.920000 --> 0:04:41\nIn fact, the debate seems to have garnered\u00a0\nso much attention in China that a company\n\n0:04:41 --> 0:04:47.880000\nwhose Mandarin name sounds like \u201cTrump\u00a0\nWins Big\u201d saw a surge of 10% in shares!\n\n0:04:47.880000 --> 0:04:51.880000\nBut it\u2019s only fair that China talks so much\u00a0\nabout the debate because the candidates sure\n\n0:04:51.880000 --> 0:04:56.680000\ntalked about China a lot during the debate.\u00a0\nDonald Trump mentioned China a dozen times.\n\n0:04:56.680000 --> 0:05:00.440000\nOnly Russia was mentioned more when\u00a0\nit came to foreign policy questions!\n\n0:05:00.440000 --> 0:05:02.160000\nWhich shouldn\u2019t be surprising, since we all know\n\n0:05:02.160000 --> 0:05:06.520000\nhow much Trump loves talking about China.\u00a0\nClips of Trump saying China over and over\n\n0:05:10.120000 --> 0:05:12.120000\nI\u2019ve really missed that.\n\n0:05:12.120000 --> 0:05:16.320000\nDuring the debate, Trump hailed his policies\u00a0\non China during his tenure in the White House,\n\n0:05:16.320000 --> 0:05:18.900000\nwhile accusing Biden of being soft on China.\n\n0:05:18.900000 --> 0:05:21.782000\nTrump: We're closer to World War III than\u00a0\nanybody can imagine. We are very very close\n\n0:05:21.782000 --> 0:05:26.760000\nto World War III, and he's driving us there,\u00a0\nand Kim Jong-un and President Xi of China,\n\n0:05:26.760000 --> 0:05:32.460000\nKim Jong-un of North Korea, all of these, Putin,\u00a0\nthey don't respect him. They don't fear him.\n\n0:05:32.460000 --> 0:05:36.840000\nTrump: We have the largest deficit with\u00a0\nChina. He gets paid by China. He's a\n\n0:05:36.840000 --> 0:05:41.440000\nManchurian candidate. He gets money from China.\u00a0\nWe have, so I think he's afraid to deal with them\n\n0:05:41.440000 --> 0:05:46.600000\nor something. But you notice he never took out my\u00a0\ntariffs because we bring in so much money with the\n\n0:05:46.600000 --> 0:05:51.680000\ntariffs that I imposed on China. He never took\u00a0\nthem away. Can't, because it's too much money.\n\n0:05:51.680000 --> 0:05:55.660000\nBiden got in on the China action, as\u00a0\nwell, though without the Trumpian flair.\n\n0:05:55.660000 --> 0:06:02.760000\nBiden: Number two: you have not in fact\u00a0\nmade any contact, any any any progress with\n\n0:06:02.760000 --> 0:06:07.800000\nChina.
